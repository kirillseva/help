## FAQ

### Do I need to open source my project when using Yue?

As long as you do not modify Yue's source code, there is no requirements on which license you should use for your project. You can link your project with Yue statically or dynamcially, or even compile Yue's source code as part of your project.

But once you have done modifications to Yue's source code, all your code linked with Yue have to be open sourced with MS-RL. The only way to remove this limitation is to subscribe to [Yue's paid plan][paid-plan].
